# CC-Converter
Simple Python program that converts Chinese characters to Mandarin, Cantonese, Hangeul (Korean) and Vietnamese and Japanese (Onyomi + Kunyomi) readings using data from Unihan. Open and run with Python 3.6.

NOTE: This program works best when user enters Traditional Chinese characters, as many simplified characters do not have readings in Korean/Japanese/Vietnamese in the database.

Data used from official Unihan Code Database: https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/

# Examples:
1. I entered two characters.
